## Experimental design

The simulated dataset used in this study consists of 1,000 genes across 48 samples. The dataset is designed to be computationally efficient, with confirmed scalability to larger real-life datasets.

The experimental design involves two batches, modeling gene expression in dioecious plants (e.g., XX/XY system) undergoing sex-specific treatments at two distinct time points: Day 0 (vegetative) and Day 1 (early flowering). Due to sex-specific treatments to alter flower sex, male and female plants were separated across batches:

Batch 1: Female controls (n=6) and treated males (n=6)

Batch 2: Male controls (n=6) and treated females (n=6)

The treatments were applied following Day 0 measurements but before Day 1 measurements, allowing Day 0 data to serve as a baseline for controlling batch effects. Samples were collected across two genotypes, with three biological replicates per combination of sex, treatment, genotype, and time point.

# Load data

```

# load metadata
coldata <- read.csv(file = "coldata.csv")

# load counts
counts <- read.csv(file = "counts.csv", row.names = 1)

```

Samples are rows in the ColData, with variables as columns. In the count file, rows are genes with samples as columns.

Batch correction on normalised counts

"For example, if the normalized count of a gene is around 1000 for XX plants in batch A and around 2000 for XX plants in batch B, the log2 fold change (LFC) of the "batch" factor is 1. Instead of shifting both batches toward the arithmetic mean (1500), which would require different scaling factors (1.5 for batch A and 1/1.333 for batch B), a symmetric transformation is applied in log space.. Specifically, all normalized counts for XX samples from batch A are multiplied by √(batch B/batch A) = √(2) ≈ 1.414, while those from batch B are divided by the same factor (or equivalently multiplied by 0.707). This proportional adjustment in log space brings both batches closer together without distorting the relative differences between conditions."

# Step 1: Load data

## Load list of genes

**Gene list must be a CSV file without headers**

Follow the provided template, where 1st columns is LOCID (e.g. LOC115696989
), 2nd column is gene common name (e.g. CsFT1), 3rd column is gene pathway (e.g. adjacent) and 4th column is the rank (i.e. the order in which the genes will be displayed)

*If this list contains LOCtest, be wary of it's effect on a principal component analysis. It should then either be removed for this step, or from the list altogether.*

{r get genes}
# Get genes of interest
gene_list <- read.csv("gene_list.csv", sep = ",", header = FALSE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Define the gene name as "of interest" for later steps
genes_of_interest <- gene_list[, 1]


## Load Rdata from "analysis : processing" output

**This includes the DESeq object, the merged colData and merged count as a matrix**

{r get data}
# Get raw data from DESeq2 processing
load("dds_filtered.RData")
load("colData.RData")
load("count_matrix.RData")


**For many QA, visualisation and exploratory steps, data from day 0 and 1 separate from flower data is needed, since the visuals are skewed by large spread from day 14 data. e.g PCA and Heatmap steps**

This filtering step must be done before performing VST, since it uses

Here, LOCtest can be removed from the **dds_filtered** object if needed.

{r get veg only data}
# Identify samples to keep for multiple PCA combinations
samples_to_keep_veg <- colData(dds_filtered)$Day != "14" # those that do not have "14" in the "Day" column
samples_to_keep_0 <- colData(dds_filtered)$Day == "0" # those that have "0" in the "Day" column

# Subset the dds_filtered object to include only the samples for each combination
dds_filtered_veg <- dds_filtered[, samples_to_keep_veg]
dds_filtered_0 <- dds_filtered[, samples_to_keep_0]


## PCA Plot of genes of interest
Intermediary quality assessment step that uses data from the DESEQDataSet post HTSFilter. It allows to check whether the genes from your list are differentially expressed in the samples, i.e. if they vary with photoperiod change, sex, treatment, cultivar or batch.

VST is applied to control for relatively higher variance at low mean counts, biasing for high-count genes.

# Generate heatmap from VST data

Since this part is quite complex, with varying amount of groups, heatmaps are created separately.

Plotting all groups together would be overwhelming, hard to decipher and values are skewed by over-expression in leaf or immature flower tissues.
