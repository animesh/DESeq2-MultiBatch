Contrast calling theory

including imbalance

base level genotype default result

averaging treatment effect on genotypes

Batch correction on normalised counts

	Quantifying basic batch effect and interaction batch effect
	Checking for consistency of batch effect across days
	Comparing basic correction with limma
	Manual data correction

PCA plot comparison

Showing bar graph with gene counts made easier

Conclusion
